    "## What is Vectorization?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vectorization** means expressing mathematical operations on entire vectors or matrices **at once**, instead of using explicit loops.  \n",
    "In Python, this is achieved using the **NumPy** library, which implements operations in optimized C code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we want to compute predictions for all data points:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without vectorization (explicit loop):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def predict(x, w, b):\n",
    "    y_hat = []\n",
    "    for i in range(len(x)):\n",
    "        y_hat.append(w * x[i] + b)\n",
    "    return np.array(y_hat)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With vectorization:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def predict(x, w, b):\n",
    "    return w * x + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `x` is a NumPy array.  \n",
    "The single line `w * x + b` performs the same computation as the loop — but much faster, because the operation is executed in compiled C code, not Python bytecode.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Vectorization is Faster\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Eliminates Python loops:**  \n",
    "   NumPy executes array operations in low-level C, avoiding the overhead of Python’s interpreter for each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Uses SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data):**  \n",
    "   The CPU performs the same operation (like addition or multiplication) on multiple data points simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory efficiency:**  \n",
    "   NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous memory blocks, improving cache performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Computing the Cost Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loop version:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def compute_cost(x, y, w, b):\n",
    "    m = len(x)\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    for i in range(m):\n",
    "        f_wb = w * x[i] + b\n",
    "        total += (f_wb - y[i]) ** 2\n",
    "    return total / (2 * m)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vectorized version:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def compute_cost(x, y, w, b):\n",
    "    m = len(x)\n",
    "    y_hat = w * x + b\n",
    "    return np.sum((y_hat - y) ** 2) / (2 * m)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both versions compute the same result, but the vectorized one can be **tens or hundreds of times faster** for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
